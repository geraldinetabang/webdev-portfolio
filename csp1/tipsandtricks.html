				<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>		
				<ul>
					<li>To upgrade your workbenches, open them, then mouse over the top button that says UPGRADE to get a tooltip telling you what you need to upgrade it.</li>
					<li>Food goes off if left long enough, however wheat never goes off until you process it, so it's a good thing to stockpile early in the game until you can get refrigerators.</li>
					<li>Farm lots of wood and plant material and craft lots of Wood Platforms for your excavation trips and make mine shafts with them as you dig. You can't teleport out of the underground, and being able to get to the surface quick is REALLY handy. I find it works better than ropes because if you fall you won't take fall damage of you do it right.</li>
					<li>You can remove the back panels of dirt underground and if you are high enough (highest background graphics only) you can teleport to your ship while underground.</li>
					<li>Escort quests are a pain but really lucrative. MAKE SURE you remove any floor spikes you anything your charge can walk though and hurt themselves with, it's almost instant death for them.</li>
					<li>Hunting spears are a great early game weapon, which also causes animals to have a much higher chance to drop meat, and are really easy to craft.</li>
					<li>don't make a base on your ship, but instead make a small holding on your starter planet. You pretty much have to farm for food in this game, and having a place where you can grow potatoes and wheat is really helpful early on.</li>
					<li>You can cook food at a station on the ground floor of the first Outpost town you come to. This was a life saver as eating cooked food reduced your hunger far more than eating raw food.</li>
					<li>Be careful when looting random towns on other planets. Dismantling furniture and walls etc will make the local populace hostile to you although you can take things out of cupboards etc pretty freely.</li>
					<li>Get your first tech upgrades ASAP. The professor looking guy in the middle of the middle floor in the Outpost can give you the quests to get them. They are really quick and being able to double jump is a god send.</li>
					<li>Be sure to explore the surface of other planets too. You might find abandoned research stations, temples and other oddities.</li>
					<li>Flags (Human Flag etc) allow you to teleport from your ship to whatever exact point you place it at. Use these to travel to your home base easily, or whenever you find somewhere you want to come back to (a settlement, etc).</li>
