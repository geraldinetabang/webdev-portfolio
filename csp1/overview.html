				<h1>Overview</h1>		
				<p>Starbound is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Chucklefish. Starbound takes place in a two-dimensional, procedurally generated universe which the player is able to explore in order to obtain new weapons, armor, and items, and to visit towns and villages inhabited by various intelligent lifeforms. Starbound was released out of early access in July 2016 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux, and is in development for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Starbound begins with the player inside a spacecraft after the destruction of Earth, home of an intergalactic peacekeeping organization known as the Terrene Protectorate, while just having graduated from its ranks. With nothing to guide it, the shuttle shoots into space without direction, becoming lost in a sea of stars. The space shuttle orbits a habitable planet and an adventure begins that takes the player hurtling across the universe. Starbound contains both quests and story driven missions, buried inside its vast sandbox universe. The space shuttle acts as the player's vehicle while exploring the galaxy, containing a teleport pad the player can use to teleport down to the planets the shuttle is visiting, a ship locker for storing items, a fuel panel for refueling the ship and a cockpit for piloting the ship. The interior of the ship is also fully customizable, with items and blocks able to be freely placed within the ship.</p>
				<br>
				<p>It can be played in multiplayer where players can work together to complete missions, look for objects/resources or just have some fun exploring the vast world. Every thing that you see in the game can be gathered with the use of the 'Matter Manipulator-- one of the useful devices that you will acquire while playing the game. You can build structures or items using the resources that you've gathered to upgrade your weapons, armors, base and many other things. The possibilities are endless.</p>

				<p>Once you finish the game, you can play it again and explore more areas and discover new and interesting items.</p>
